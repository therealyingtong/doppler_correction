\section{Correction using timing beacon on satellite}
The timing beacon correction method installs a beacon with regular pulses on the satellite. We time-stamp the beacon signal both on the satellite and at the ground station (Fig \ref{fig:beacon}). If we find the cross correlation between the beacon pulses registered on the satellite timestamp and those registered on the ground station, we can apply the same transformation to the idler and signal photoevents. We find that even a high jitter beacon with poor detection efficiency is sufficient to correct for all clock drifts including the change of the Doppler shift for high elevation angles.

\subsection{Cross-correlation using FFT}

The second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ is the intensity analogue of the first-order correlation function $g^{(1)}(\tau)$ that determines the visibility of interference fringes. $g^{(1)}(\tau)$ quantifies the way in which the electric field fluctuates in time, whereas $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ quantifies the intensity fluctuations.
