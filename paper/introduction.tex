\section{Introduction}
Entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on a steady source of photon pairs. The first step in establishing a key in such a scheme is the assignment of photodetection events to entangled photon pairs \cite{ho2009clock}. Due to their strong temporal correlation (down to a few 100 fs) in typical pair sources, this assignment can be done via temporal coincidence identification. However, for satellite-based photon pair sources, complexity from Doppler shift rates at different angles of elevation can cause this cross correlation to be spread out over thousands of time bins. This note introduces two methods for correcting Doppler effects in satellite-to-ground coincidence matching. 

\subsection{Time stamping a satellite SPDC source}

We consider a setup where a spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) source on a satellite is time-stamped by two individual time-stamp cards with a relative clock drift of 165$\mu$s/s (Fig \ref{fig:spdc_source}).\\

\subsection{Doppler shifts and clock drifts}
We introduce a Doppler shift for each time-stamp based on pair generation time. When the elevation angle is at its maximum 90$^\circ$, we define that $t$ is 0 seconds. Assuming that the satellite is in a circular orbit at altitude $h = 500$km, with a carrier frequency of $f_c = 1$MHz, a simplified expression for the carrier Doppler shift can be given by:

\begin{figure}[ht!]

	\label{fig:orbit}
	\end{minipage}%
	\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
		\begin{align}
		V &= \sqrt{\frac{R^2}{r} \cdot g}, \label{eq1} \\
		\gamma &= \frac{V \cdot t}{r}, \label{eq2} \\
		\theta &= \arccos\Big(\frac{r\sin\gamma}{s}\Big), \label{eq3} \\
		s &= \sqrt{R^2 + r^2 - 2Rr\cos(\gamma)}, \label{eq4}\\
		f_d &= f_c \Big(\frac{V}{c} \cos\theta\Big). \label{eq5}
		\end{align}
	\end{minipage}
	\caption{A simplified schematic of the satellite's orbit.}
\end{figure}

\noindent where $R$ is the Earth's radius, $r = R + h$, $g$ is gravitational acceleration, and $c$ is the speed of light. Equation (\ref{eq1}) is the velocity of the satellite; (\ref{eq2}) is its orbital phase angle $\gamma$; (\ref{eq3}) is its angle of elevation $\theta$; (\ref{eq4}) is its distance from the ground station $s$; and (\ref{eq5}) is the Doppler shift of the carrier signal from the satellite.

Using this model, we specify an absolute time offset of 
\begin{equation}
\Delta t = \frac{s(t)}{c}, \label{eq6}
\end{equation}
where distance is calculated for each pair generation time in orbit (Fig \ref{fig:doppler_shift}(a)).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Complications from changing Doppler shifts} 
The time offset $\Delta t$ (eq. \ref{eq6}) can be easily corrected (Fig \ref{fig:correlation_smear}(a) and \ref{fig:correlation_smear}(b)); in fact, it is almost one order of magnitude less than the clock drift. Harder to correct for is the \textbf{relative frequency difference between the satellite and ground-station clocks}, caused by the change in Doppler shift over time (Fig \ref{fig:doppler_shift_rate}). Since the stream of time stamps $\{t_i\}$ and $\{t_j\}$ on each side has no intrinsic time structure, it is difficult to distinguish a signal event from a background event in the frequency-shifted $\{t'_j\}$ (Fig \ref{fig:correlation_smear}(c)).\\ 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{assets/correlation_smear.png}
	\caption{Effect of Doppler shift and Doppler shift rate on photoevent sets. Trace (a) represents the event set $\{t_i\}$ on side  A, trace (b) an event  set $\{tâ€²_j\}$ on side B  with a time offset $\frac{s(t)}{c}$ , but  the  same reference clock frequency. Trace (c) illustrates a set $\{t'_j\}$ with an additional relative frequency difference $\delta$ between both reference clocks. Image adapted from \cite{ho2009clock}.}
	\label{fig:correlation_smear}
\end{figure}

The change in the Doppler shift over time is highest at $90^\circ$ elevation angle and can reach up to nearly 400 ns/s$^2$ (Fig \ref{fig:doppler_shift_rate}). This causes a change in relative clock drift over time. This stretch is of the order of microseconds per second (23 $\mu$s/s for Doppler, 165 $\mu$s/s for clock drifts) and it causes the cross correlation to be spread out thousands of time bins, making it difficult to distinguish a significant peak in the cross correlation.

	\end{minipage}%
	\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
		To correct for this, we introduce a second order term to our time shift equation:
		\begin{equation}
		\Delta t = \frac{s(t)}{c} + \delta \cdot t,
		\end{equation}
		
		where the Doppler shift $\delta$ is defined by (cf. eq. \ref{eq5})
		
		\begin{equation}
		\delta = \frac{V}{c} \cos\theta.
		\end{equation}
