\section{Results and discussion}

\noindent\texttt{insert graph of gain function over iterations for different degrees and learning rates}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
	\item g
	\item time taken to run
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Validation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item validate using timestamps from real passes
	\item show recovery of key, QBER etc. (or include reference to paper / code which can do it)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations and future directions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item main bottleneck is cross-correlation: sidestep with caching / windowing?
	\item adaptive learning rates
	\item gradient descent on other fits besides polynomial (e.g. spline?)
\end{itemize}
