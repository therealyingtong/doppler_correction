#SPEQS (Small Photon-Entangling Quantum System)
Entanglement demonstration experiment in a satellite

Doppler correction: correcting time of flight of photon pair from satellite to ground
- currently: use pulse laser sequences with known frequencies
- improvement: use intrinsic entangled photon correlation

- need to understand losses between satellite and ground
